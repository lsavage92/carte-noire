I have a goal now! My fianc√© is currently an Earth Science student and has to deal with a lot of data. It has been recommended to her from her mentors that she studies programming so she can be more effective in her field. Naturally as a nerd this excited me and made me want to be a better python developer. 

So, in order to help her learn python this coming summer, I will dive into tensorflow and try to make some sense out of machine learning. If I find that I'm not doing enough python during the machine learning course, I will likely switch over to playing with django.

The course I'm going to be taking is the [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course). It seems like a general enough introduction and then I will move on to either the Tensorflow guides or maybe experiment on my own!
